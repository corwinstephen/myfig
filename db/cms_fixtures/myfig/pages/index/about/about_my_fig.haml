%h1 What is MyFig?
%p
  The Figueroa Corridor Streetscape project (MyFigueroa) seeks to transform the Figueroa Corridor into a complete, multimodal street that better serves the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit riders, while still accommodating drivers. We hope to accomplish this through improvements in three major areas:
%ul
  %li Adding better signalization and signage, high-visibility crosswalks, transit platforms,   more street trees, and public art to make the pedestrian and transit-rider experience   safer and more enjoyable .
  %li Developing a three-mile bikeway which will build a transformative link between  Downtown and South Los Angeles, expand the City’s bicycle network and help to   implement the City’s Bicycle  Master Plan
  %li Creating separated cycle tracks where bicycles will be separated from roadway traffic,  decreasing injury crashes between non-motorized and motorized users.

%p The project is fully supported by Council District 9 and the Mayor’s Office as a “signature project” for Los Angeles. MyFigueroa is being managed locally by the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT).

%h1 Where is it?
%p The project area includes four miles of streets that stretch from downtown L.A.  to South Los Angeles: Figueroa Street from 7th Street in downtown Los Angeles to 41st Street, just south of Exposition Park; 11th Street from Figueroa Street east to Broadway in the South Park neighborhood of downtown Los Angeles; and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from Figueroa Street west to Vermont Avenue, on the south edge of Exposition Park.

%h1 Why should I support it?
%h2 MyFigueroa is remaking Figueroa Street for people  
%p In other cities (like Long Beach, New York, San Francisco, Minneapolis, Miami, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Portland, Austin and Memphis) similar projects have been implemented which have proven to better balance the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders and motorists; these projects show increased safety for all users and create a more vibrant, healthy community. This project has the potential to dramatically transform the Figueroa Corridor from a regional freeway alternative into a more “complete” street that still maintains vehicular access, but also provides a safer, more comfortable local environment for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders.

%h2 MyFigueroa links Expo Park and USC to Downtown  
%p The Corridor is home to some of L.A.’s most notable landmarks and destinations, as well as a series of vibrant and diverse neighborhoods. It includes entertainment, corporate and commercial centers of Downtown’s Financial District and L.A. Live/Staples Center/LA Convention Center; the higher education institutions of USC, Mount Saint Mary’s and Los Angeles Trade Tech College; and the cultural landmarks in Exposition Park including the California Science Center, the Coliseum, the California African American Museum and the Natural History Museum. The enhanced Figueroa Corridor will create a unifying streetscape that links these destinations together. 

%h2 MyFigueroa creates a transformative new bike and pedestrian experience for the city
%p From Exposition Boulevard to 21st Street, the project will feature L.A.’s first cycle tracks: bike lanes separated from roadway traffic by a combination of physical barriers, parking lanes and bus platforms. Cycle tracks are proven to dramatically enhance safety for all users of the street and increase bicycle ridership by providing a comfortable facility for a wide range of cycling abilities. In addition to the proposed streetscape improvements on Figueroa, streetscape enhancements on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard will enhance the pedestrian experience along the southern edge of Exposition Park, and 11th Street will be transformed with wide sidewalks and new landscaping.
